# Demographic and Census Data Analysis SQL Project
### Demographic Insights: Analyzing Census Data with SQL

This SQL project aims to analyze demographic and census data from two datasets: `data1` and `data2`. The project involves exploring the datasets, analyzing demographic trends, and deriving insights from various SQL queries.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform comprehensive analysis and gain insights into demographic and census data, including population statistics, growth rates, sex ratios, literacy rates, and more.

## Project Outline

### Data Exploration

- Fetching data from `data1` and `data2` datasets.
- Determining the number of rows in each dataset.
- Filtering data for specific states like Jharkhand and Bihar.
- Calculating the population of India.

### Analysis of Demographic Data

- Computing the average growth rate for each state.
- Calculating the average sex ratio for each state.
- Identifying states with an average literacy rate greater than 90%.
- Determining the top 3 states with the highest growth ratio.
- Finding the bottom 3 states with the lowest sex ratio.
- Analyzing the top and bottom 3 states in terms of literacy rate.
- Extracting states starting with specific letters.

### Joining and Aggregating Data

- Joining `data1` and `data2` to analyze total males and females.
- Calculating the total literacy rate for each state.
- Analyzing population in previous census.
- Comparing population vs. area for previous and current census data.

### Window Functions

- Outputting the top 3 districts from each state with the highest literacy rate using window functions.

## Usage

To replicate the results of this project, execute the provided SQL queries against the respective datasets `data1` and `data2`. Ensure proper access to the databases containing the datasets before running the queries.
